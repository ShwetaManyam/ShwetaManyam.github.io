								<p>
									Allow me to introduce myself – I'm someone who takes pride in maintaining an organized and tidy lifestyle.
									I'm an avid reader, and I love exploring books of various genres, from mystery novels to science fictions.
									<br>I'm also a content writing enthusiast, and I've written articles for both the college magazine and a local online platform.
									<br>I love coffee, all things technological, and I have a special fondness for our four-legged companions, particularly dogs.
									Oh, and my shoes.
									<br>One of my favorite hobbies is drawing/sketching.
									I find it to be a great way to unwind and a way to monitor my feelings.
									I have also recently explored digital illustration which has made my planner and check-lists much cuter.
									<br>According to the insights from personality tests, I'm categorized as an INTJ-A.
									Being introverted and assertiveness comes naturally to me.
									<br>Yet I acknowledge the importance of embracing extroverted tendencies when my professional responsibilities demand it.
									It extends to group settings as well. I earned commendable feedback following a mock group discussion.
									One of my personality traits happens to be a calm and approachable demeanor that encourages interactions right from the outset.

										<h2>Now... Why Engineering..?</h2>
									</header>
									I don't know if I can put this right but here's my concise answer.
									I've always found computers fascinating. Technology - isn't it easy and yet so complicated all at the same time and makes you curious?.<br>
									I remember my first Computer Science lab and I was assigned a system. I was so happy and the jittery feeling did't go away till weeks.<br>
									Since then, Computer science, in particular, has been a subject I've genuinely found engaging.<br>
									Engineering seemed like the logical path to further explore this passion. While I may not have a specific extraordinary reason, my strong affinity for computers led me to pursue engineering.
